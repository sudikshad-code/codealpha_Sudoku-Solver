# codealpha_Sudoku-Solver
● Represent the Sudoku grid as a 2D array.  ● Implement a backtracking algorithm to fill empty cells with valid numbers.  ● Check for the Sudoku rules (row, column, and 3x3 subgrid constraints) before placing a number. ● Recursively try possible numbers until the puzzle is solved.
